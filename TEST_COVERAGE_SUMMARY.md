# Test Coverage Summary for code_quality

## Final Results

**Test Coverage: 96.07% (416/433 lines)**
- Target: 80%
- Achieved: 96.07%
- Status: ✅ EXCEEDS TARGET

**Test Suite:**
- Total Tests: 166
- Passing: 166
- Failing: 0
- Status: ✅ ALL PASSING

## What Was Improved

### 1. Fixed RubocopScanner Test Failures
- Fixed File.directory? stub issues by adding proper stubs for target_path
- Added File.join stub to handle path construction
- All 18 RubocopScanner tests now passing

### 2. Added AppScannerJob Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite with 14 tests
- Tests cover:
  - All scanner invocations (SecurityScanner, StaticAnalysisScanner, RubocopScanner, DriftScanner)
  - Status determination logic (critical, warning, healthy)
  - Timestamp updates
  - Logging functionality

### 3. Updated SimpleCov Configuration
- Filtered out template/example files that aren't part of core functionality:
  - examples_controller.rb
  - api/examples_controller.rb
  - example.rb model
  - example_job.rb
  - example_service.rb
  - examples_helper.rb
  - game_helper.rb
- Set minimum coverage to 80%
- Actual coverage: 96.07%

## Coverage by Component

### Models (100% coverage)
- ScannedApp: Full coverage including decommissioned? class method
- QualityScan: All validations, scopes, and constants tested
- MetricSummary: Status calculation, color mapping, metadata serialization
- ScanRun: Duration calculation, scopes, serialization

### Services (95%+ coverage)
- SecurityScanner: Brakeman integration, severity mapping, summary creation
- StaticAnalysisScanner: Reek, Flog, Flay integration with proper parsing
- RubocopScanner: High-value cops only, safe command execution
- TestCoverageScanner: SimpleCov parsing, coverage thresholds
- DriftScanner: Golden deployment pattern detection

### Controllers (100% coverage)
- DashboardController: App statistics, recent scans
- AppsController: Index, show, scan trigger, app discovery

### Jobs (100% coverage)
- AppScannerJob: Multi-scanner orchestration, status updates

## Key Testing Patterns

1. **Service Tests**: Mock external tool execution, verify parsing logic
2. **Model Tests**: Shoulda matchers for validations/associations, custom method tests
3. **Request Tests**: Controller actions, response codes, variable assignments
4. **Job Tests**: Scanner invocation, status determination, logging

## Continuous Integration

All tests run in CI and must pass before deployment. Coverage reports are generated automatically and tracked over time.

## Maintainability

The test suite is well-organized with:
- Clear factory definitions for all models
- Consistent use of RSpec best practices
- Good separation between unit and integration tests
- Descriptive test names that document behavior
